# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Kiro is an intelligent "Web Mind" - a personal AI agent that lives inside the user's browser. The system watches user web activity (with consent), learns behavioral patterns, and provides contextual assistance through summarization, suggestions, and automation of everyday web actions. The platform combines Chrome AI/Gemini Nano with a modern web interface to create a humanized browser assistant experience.
